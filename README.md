# Binius64

Binius64 is a zero-knowledge succinct argument system (zk-SNARK), implemented in Rust. Binius64 is capable of proving arbitrary computations, expressed as non-deterministic circuits over 64-bit words.

Binius64 is a successor to the [original Binius protocol](https://github.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius), with a focus on simplicity and CPU performance. The constraint system natively encodes bitwise operations on 64-bit words through *shifted value indices*, which combine value references with shift operations. This design achieves a 64-fold reduction in constraint complexity compared to bit-level approaches while maintaining the efficiency advantages of binary field arithmetic. The protocol targets modern 64-bit CPUs with SIMD instructions, making it practical for real-world applications requiring zero-knowledge proofs.

## Dependencies

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/): We recommend using rustup to install the Rust compiler and Cargo toolchain.

## Usage

### Building

Binius64 implements optimizations for certain target architectures. To enable these, export the environment variable

```bash
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"
```

When including binius64 as a dependency, it is recommended to add the following lines to your `Cargo.toml` file to have optimizations across crates

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = "thin"
```

### Running Examples

The `prover/examples/` directory contains example circuits, which you can run using the [CLI framework](https://www.binius.xyz/building/getting-started/cli).

For example, to run an example proving a SHA-512 preimage:

```bash
$ RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" cargo run --release --example sha512 prove --max-len-bytes 65536 --exact-len
   Finished `release` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `target/release/examples/sha512 prove --max-len-bytes 65536 --exact-len`

...
```

### Disabling multithreading

Multithreading is enabled by default using [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon). This is controlled by the `rayon` Cargo feature. To run an example with multithreading disabled, use `--no-default-features`.
