/// Circuit builder for constructing zero-knowledge proof circuits.
///
/// `CircuitBuilder` provides the primary interface for constructing circuits in the Binius64
/// proof system. The builder compiles imperative gate operations into a constraint system
/// suitable for zero-knowledge proof generation.
///
/// # Circuit Model
///
/// A circuit represents computation as a directed acyclic graph where 64-bit values flow
/// through gates via **wires**. Gates transform input wires to produce output wires.
/// Methods like [`band`] and [`iadd_32`] add gates to the graph and return handles
/// to output wires.
///
/// During [`build`], the gate graph compiles into AND and MUL constraints
/// that the proof system operates on directly.
///
/// # Wire Types
///
/// Wires are handles to 64-bit values that exist during proof generation.
/// During circuit construction, wires represent value placeholders.
///
/// **Constants** - Values known at compile time. Zero constraint cost as both prover
/// and verifier know these values. Created with [`add_constant`].
///
/// **Public inputs/outputs** - Values visible to both prover and verifier.
/// Form part of the proof statement (e.g., hash output in a preimage proof).
/// Created with [`add_inout`](Self::add_inout).
///
/// **Private witnesses** - Values known only to the prover.
/// The circuit proves knowledge of these values without revealing them
/// (e.g., preimage in a hash proof). Created with [`add_witness`](Self::add_witness).
///
/// **Internal wires** - Created automatically by gate operations.
/// Represent intermediate computation values.
///
/// # MSB-Boolean Convention
///
/// Boolean values encode in the most significant bit (bit 63) of a 64-bit word.
/// MSB = 1 represents true, MSB = 0 represents false.
/// The lower 63 bits are "don't care" values.
///
/// # Constraint Costs
///
/// **AND constraints** - Baseline unit of cost. Bitwise operations and comparisons
/// generate 1-2 AND constraints.
///
/// **MUL constraints** - 64-bit multiplication costs ~3-4× more than AND constraints.
///
/// **Committed values** - Each public input/output and witness adds to proof size
/// (~0.2× of an AND constraint).
///
/// **Linear operations** - XOR and shifts generate virtual linear constraints.
/// During compilation these either:
/// - Fuse into adjacent non-linear gates (near-zero cost)
/// - Materialize as AND constraints
///
/// Gate fusion inlines compatible XOR expressions and shifts into existing AND gates.
/// Incompatible operations (e.g., right shift into left shift) and heuristic limits
/// prevent some fusions. XORs typically cost <0.1× of an AND constraint,
/// shifts slightly more.
///
/// # Compilation
///
/// The builder uses reference-counted sharing internally. [`subcircuit`] returns
/// a builder referencing the same graph with hierarchical naming.
///
/// [`build`] triggers compilation:
/// 1. Validates the circuit structure
/// 2. Runs optimization passes (constant propagation, gate fusion)
/// 3. Generates the final constraint system
///
/// [`build`] consumes internal state and can only be called once per builder instance.
