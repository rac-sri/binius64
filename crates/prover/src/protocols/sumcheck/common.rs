/// A sumcheck prover with a round-by-round execution interface.
///
/// Sumcheck prover logic is accessed via a trait because important optimizations are available
/// depending on the structure of the multivariate polynomial that the protocol targets. For
/// example, [Gruen24] observes a significant optimization available to the sumcheck prover when
/// the multivariate is the product of a multilinear composite and an equality indicator
/// polynomial, which arises in the zerocheck protocol.
///
/// The trait exposes a round-by-round interface so that protocol execution logic that drives the
/// prover can interleave the executions of the interactive protocol, for example in the case of
/// batching several sumcheck protocols.
///
/// The caller must make a specific sequence of calls to the provers. For a prover where
/// [`Self::n_vars`] is $n$, the caller must call [`Self::execute`] and then [`Self::fold`] $n$
/// times, and finally call [`Self::finish`]. If the calls aren't made in that order, the caller
/// will get an error result.
///
/// This trait is _not_ object-safe.
